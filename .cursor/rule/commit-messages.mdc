# Commit Message Rules

## Language
- Use English for all commit messages

- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor" not "Moves cursor")

## Message Structure
- Subject line (50 chars or less)
- Blank line
- Body (72 chars per line)
- Blank line
- Footer (optional)

## Subject Line
- Maximum 50 characters
- Capitalize first letter
- No period at the end
- Use imperative mood
- No prefixes like "feat:", "fix:", "chore:", etc.
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)

## Message Body
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use to explain what and why vs. how

- Contrast with previous behavior

## Examples
Good:

- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add login and registration endpoints
- Create user model and migration
- Set up password hashing with bcrypt
```

Bad:
```

when users tried to do things it didn't work but now it does
```
